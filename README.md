# Vibe ‚ú®

*A modern social platform that bridges the online-to-offline gap using the trust and transparency of Web3.*

## The Problem We're Solving

Modern social apps have a problem. They've become a game of endless, superficial swiping that rarely leads to real-life connections, leaving users feeling burnt out and isolated. Furthermore, users are forced to trust these centralized platforms with their data, identity, and payments, with little to no transparency.

## Our Solution: Vibe

Vibe is a social connection platform built on two core principles: **authentic experiences** and **verifiable trust**.

1.  **Experience-Driven:** We shift the focus from endless swiping to shared real-world activities. A match isn't the end goal; it's the invitation to an **Event**, closing the online-to-offline gap.
2.  **Trust-Driven:** We use Web3 to solve the trust deficit. Identity is secured by a user's wallet, and premium features are handled by a transparent smart contract, giving users full control and visibility.

## üîë Key Features

- **üì± Modern & Dynamic UI:** A beautiful, responsive glassmorphism UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, featuring a dynamic theme switcher for light and dark modes.
- **‚ù§Ô∏è Intelligent Swiping:** A "dating app" style card-swiping interface that dynamically fetches real user profiles from the backend, complete with high-quality images hosted on a scalable cloud bucket.
- **ü§ù Mutual Matching System:** An advanced backend that intelligently detects mutual "likes" and automatically upgrades a pending request to an "accepted" match in real-time.
- **üîê Web3-Powered Identity:** Secure, passwordless authentication using a crypto wallet (via RainbowKit & Wagmi), with a seamless backend sync to create and retrieve user profiles.
- **üíé On-Chain Premium Memberships:** A "Go Premium" feature that interacts with a live **Solidity smart contract** on the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet to process payments transparently.
- **üèõÔ∏è Privacy-by-Design Architecture:** A hybrid model that keeps all sensitive user data (profiles, messages) secure and private in an off-chain database while leveraging the blockchain for trust.

## üöÄ How to Demo (Core User Flow)

1.  **Connect Wallet:** Visit the live app and connect your wallet. A user profile will be automatically created in the backend.
2.  **Swipe Right:** Swipe right or click the heart button on a few profiles. This sends a "pending" match request to the backend.
3.  **Create a Mutual Match:** To simulate a mutual match for the demo, use Postman to send a reverse "like" from one of the profiles you just liked (e.g., `{ "user1Id": 2, "user2Id": 1 }`).
4.  **View Matches:** Navigate to the "Matches" page. You will see your new, accepted match appear, with their real image pulled from the S3 bucket.
5.  **Go Premium (The Web3 Magic):** Click the "Go Premium" button in the navbar. Approve the 10 ARB transaction in your wallet. The UI will instantly update to show your new "Premium" status.
